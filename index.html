<h4>About me:</h4>
<p>Hello! I'm Laura, I'm a soon-to-be graduate of Thinkful's Full-stack web developer boot camp. I'm an Atlanta
	native but I've traveled all over the world.

	The thing I'm the most passionate about is my family. I've been married for 6 years and our family includes myself,
	my husband, our daughter, two dogs and one very mean cat.
	My daughter will be celebrating her 2nd birthday this summer and being a mother
